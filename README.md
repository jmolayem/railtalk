This app uses free unstructured voice requests to predict arrival times for nearby trains. 

For example, the expo lineâ€™s Expo Park / USC station can be free structured to similar inputs: 
Exposition, expo, USC, Coliseum, SC, Jefferson St, and so and so forth. 

Sample question structure: when will the ____ arrive at _____?

i.e. - When will the gold line arrive at Del Mar Station?

It is built using iOS (Swift), the Wit.ai API for natural language processing, and the LA Metro Rail API.
